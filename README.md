# What We Are Using Toronto Public Libraries For

## Overview

I look at the statistics of the Toronto Public Libraries from 2012-2022 in order 
to determine when they were most used by the public and answer why that was the case.
I look at the number of visits, books that went in and out, new registrations, and the 
amount of computer sessions across Toronto's 103 public libraries (as of 2023 as this number does change). Each data set was obtained from OpenDataToronto. 

LLMs WERE NOT USED AT ALL IN MAKING THIS REPORT.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.

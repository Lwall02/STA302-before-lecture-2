## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
# install.packages("opendatatoronto")

library(opendatatoronto)

library_visits_raw_data <- read_csv("tpl-visits-annual-by-branch-2012-2022.csv")

# head(library_visits_raw_data)

library_visits_raw_data |>
  summarise(year = Year, average_visits = mean(Visits), 
            .by = BranchCode) |>
  arrange(average_visits)

library_visits_raw_data |>
  arrange(BranchCode)
```
